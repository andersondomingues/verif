[Julien Schmaltz](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Schmaltz:Julien) has few papers related to Formal Verification 
of Networks-on-Chip and he often uses Hermes NoC as case study, the same router we will use on this course. 

The main ideia is to explore few of his papers to expand our knowledge beyond the 3 reference books we used, 
using a practical case study we are familiar with. Hopefully, this study will give us few nice ideias to implement in class.

So, the students have to select one of [Julien's papers](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=hSWqEGYAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=sra
) related to FV of NoCs to discuss in class. A brief summary of up two pages is also expected.
